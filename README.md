- 👋 Hi, I’m @alejandrohagan 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about R, Bash, lua, CSS, revealjs, mermaid diagramming & observable.js
- 🌱 I’m currently writing a package to help with business intelligence analysis and to help others in learning R (called fpaR)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone that wants to develop and maintain a package to meet the needs of the typical FP&A department
-   I'm also interested in creating packages focused on the energy industry -- everything from oil & gas to renewables (open to ideas!)
